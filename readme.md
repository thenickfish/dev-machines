# Nick's Development Machines of Wonder

Why does this exist? I got a new computer (again) and decided I'm sick of setting up the same applications over and over, and polluting all my computers with a million different tools. These are some vagrant machines set up for the way I like to do development. I'm going to split them out into different machines for different "workloads" instead of going with a kitchen sink approach.

## Getting Started

* enable hyper v
* install vagrant
* clone this repository
* cd to one of the machine folders
* run 'vagrant up'
* write awesome code
* run 'vagrant destroy'
* profit
